Hey everyone,

It's been a pretty technical week this time around.  Most of my time has been put toward helping students, fixing issues in CrashSimulator and making improvements.

* Fixed four or five bugs that the students have encountered as they’ve been using the tool.  Most of these were simple edge cases that I hadn’t run into before.

* Ported several mutators and checkers from the old CrashSimulator prototype to this new tool.

* Improved areas of the tools documentation.  I’m going to add documents describing each of the anomalies we’ve used.  I hope to get this finished up and pushed tomorrow.

* Worked with several students via email and in person on issues they were encountering.  There have been some common problem areas that I’ve tried to address in the tools documentation.  I’ll be sure to mention these in the next class.

* Investigated some ways to ease the difficulty of “lining up” strace output with the correct rr events. I merged a PR from Joey improvements to our heuristics that reduced the number of “potential” events.  I did a comparison of a bunch of different traces and have some ideas about how I can cut a great deal of preamble system calls that might help things.

* Merged PR from Alan fixing a bug with posix-omni-parser

* Worked with Alex to test and distributed a portable VMWare image with the tool installed correctly.

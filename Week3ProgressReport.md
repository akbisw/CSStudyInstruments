# Week 3 Progress Report

Went back to testing sort again. This time may have found a bug I could focus on.

* Checked every filetype anomalies on all 3 stat calls.

* The last stat call generates a ReplayDeltaError for char file type and following Preston's advice, now I'm looking into where and what is responding to this filetype in coreutils source code.
